## feedback.html

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/feedback-page.png" alt="feedback page">

The feedback form on the "Edu Fun Zone" website allows users to provide their feedback about the website or its content. The form collects the following details from the user:
* Name: Users are required to enter their name in the designated field.
* Mobile Number: Users are asked to provide their mobile number for contact purposes.
* Email: Users need to enter their email address for communication purposes.
* Feedback: There is a text area where users can write their feedback.

Once the user submits the feedback, the website displays a thank-you message to acknowledge the submission. Additionally, the details submitted by the user, including their name, mobile number, email, and feedback, are displayed on the same page.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/feedback-return-msg.png" alt="feedback Return Message">

The feedback form serves as a valuable tool for users to share their thoughts, suggestions, or concerns about the website. It allows the website administrators to gather feedback and make improvements based on user input. The inclusion of a thank-you message and displaying the submitted details on the same page enhances the user experience and provides transparency in the feedback process.

## 404.html
A 404 page is an error page that is displayed when a server cannot find the requested webpage.By implementing a custom 404 page in this project, we can enhance the user experience and provide a helpful and visually appealing error page.

 Also it guides users back to the home page without closing the tag.

# Wireframes

The wireframe design created for the "Edu Fun Zone" website using Photoshop follows a structured approach to visualize the layout and functionality of the site. 

The wireframe design process begins with thorough research and planning. This involves understanding the goals of the website, identifying user needs, and determining the information hierarchy of the design

The wireframe serves as the skeleton of the website, focusing on the layout and structure rather than the content and aesthetics.

# Technologies used

The Edu Fun Zone website was created using the Visual Studio code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository https://github.com/EbyChacko/project2_game.git

And a variety of technologies used, including:

- HTML: HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of the website.

- CSS: CSS is used to style the website and control its layout. It is used to add colors, fonts, and other design elements to the website.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website. It is used to create animations, validate forms, and more.

- Photoshop: Photoshop is an image editor and wireframe tool used to create the wireframe for the website. It allows designers to create a visual representation of the website's layout and structure. It is also used to create the GIF files  as well.

- GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code, track changes, and work together on projects.

Overall, these technologies were used to create a functional and visually appealing website that provides a fun and interactive learning experience for its users.


# Testing 
## Responsiveness & Functionality testing 
 I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

The Chrome Developer Tools are great for debugging any website.

## Compatibility testing
 Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. The Chrome Developer Tools also have an option to preview your website on different devices. This includes different types of mobile devices, iPads, tablets, and more 
 
 I checked all supported devices in Chrome developer tool. 
 
 I tested on hardware devices such as: iphone, macbook, azuz laptop etc.

 Some of the screenshots are given below.
 ### Home page in deferent devices

 ## Browser Compatibility testing
 For the Edu Fun Zone website I tested the browser compatibility using Safari, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge, and everything was found to be good.

## Errors
During testing with the Chrome Developer Tools, an error was encountered: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'querySelectorAll')". This error occurs when trying to access the querySelectorAll method on a null value, specifically a DOM element that doesn't exist.

<img src="assets/images/readme-images/Error-tic-tac-toe.png" alt="Error found tic tac toe">

To resolve this error, the script file was split for each page. By doing this, the code ensures that the DOM elements it needs to access are available before attempting to use the 'querySelectorAll' method.


## Validator Testing 
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Febychacko.github.io%2Fproject2_game%2F)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [W3C CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=+https%3A%2F%2Febychacko.github.io%2Fproject2_game%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

- Java Script
    - When passing through the [jshint.com](https://jshint.com/), found some variables were seen undefined. I declare the variable to resolve the problem. No other issues found during test.
## Accessibility Test
During the Accessibility test conducted with WAVE, an error was identified: "Empty form label". This error occurs when a <label> tag is present in the form and associated with an input field, but does not contain any text.
<img src="assets/images/readme-images/error-wave-empty label.png" alt="Error found empty form label">

To resolve this error, added a label for each input section in the website. By adding descriptive text within the `label` tags, the form controls are now properly labeled, ensuring accessibility for all users.

No other errors were found when passing through the official WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool. 

[Check Result Here](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://ebychacko.github.io/project2_game/).

## Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

### Desktop Results
All pages of the site are achieving a score 100 across the 4 categories in lighthouse for the desktop view.
