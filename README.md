Welcome to [Edu Fun Zone](https://ebychacko.github.io/project2_game/),

Edu Fun Zone is a website that combines fun and education in two main features: a Tic Tac Toe game and a calculator. The Website is created Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The game is turn-based, where the aim is to line up a trifecta of circles or crosses diagonally, horizontally, or vertically on a 3Ã—3 square grid to achieve victory. 

 The calculator feature can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and persentage. The website is designed to be both entertaining and educational, providing a fun way for users to learn and practice their math skills.
