            <p>Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun game that can be played by anyone. Here are the steps to play Tic Tac Toe
                clearly with pictures:</p>
            <div id="text-content">

                    <li>Open Edu-Fun-Zone page and choose TIC-TAC-TOE.</li>
                    <li>Add Two Player Details.</li>
                    <li>The player1 will have the icon "X" and the player two will have the icon "O".</li>
                    <li>Click the "START" button.</li>
                    <li>Click the "TOSS" button to choose the first player from the above two players.</li>
                    <li>The player who win the toss will choose by the computer and will show in the notification area.
                        And
                        he/ she will play first.</li>
                    <li>Players take turns placing their symbols until one player gets three in a row horizontally,
                        vertically, or diagonally.</li>
                    <li>If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.</li>
                    <li>The game is over when one player gets three in a row or when the game is a tie.</li>
                    <li>ENJOY The Game.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Remember, Tic Tac Toe is a zero-sum game, which means that if both players are playing their best, then
                neither player will win. However, it is still a fun and educational game to play.</p>
